1;Postoperative pneumatosis intestinalis in infants does not automatically preclude enteral feeding.; A degree of feed intolerance after neonatal abdominal surgery is common but in an otherwise well baby enteral feeding usually is continued at the highest tolerated level. However, the presence of rectal bleeding, pneumatosis intestinalis, or portal vein gas seen on plain abdominal x-rays suggest the possibility of postoperative necrotising enterocolitis. When this happens feedings usually are stopped for 7 to 10 days, and intravenous antibiotics and total parental nutrition are commenced. METHODS: The authors report 12 episodes of rectal bleeding and 11 episodes of pneumatosis intestinalis in 3 infants who previously had undergone neonatal abdominal surgery for intestinal malformations. In 7 of these episodes, feedings were neither stopped nor were antibiotics given. At the time of these 7 episodes, the infants were more than 3 kg in weight, had no significant cardiac or respiratory pathology, were all clinically stable, had no evidence of peritonitis, had no thrombocytopenia, and were greater than 37 weeks postconception. RESULTS: The 3 infants were monitored closely. There were no early or late problems observed attributable to this management. CONCLUSION: Carefully selected clinically stable patients that have postoperative pneumatosis intestinalis or exhibit rectal bleeding may be successfully managed by reduced enteral feedings with no antibiotics.

2;Selective decontamination of the digestive tract in gastrointestinal surgery: useful in infection prevention? A systematic review.;Gastrointestinal surgery is associated with a high incidence of infectious complications. Selective decontamination of the digestive tract is an antimicrobial prophylaxis regimen that aims to eradicate gastrointestinal carriage of potentially pathogenic microorganisms and represents an adjunct to regular prophylaxis in surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Relevant studies were identified using bibliographic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database (period from 1970 to November 1, 2012). Only studies investigating selective decontamination of the digestive tract in gastrointestinal surgery were included. RESULTS: Two randomized clinical trials and one retrospective case-control trial showed significant benefit in terms of infectious complications and anastomotic leakage in colorectal surgery. Two randomized controlled trials in esophageal surgery and two randomized clinical trials in gastric surgery reported lower levels of infectious complications. CONCLUSION: Selective decontamination of the digestive tract reduces infections following esophageal, gastric, and colorectal surgeries and also appears to have beneficial effects on anastomotic leakage in colorectal surgery. We believe these results provide the basis for a large multicenter prospective study to investigate the role of selective decontamination of the digestive tract in colorectal surgery.
3;Perioperative selective decontamination of the digestive tract and standard antibiotic prophylaxis versus standard antibiotic prophylaxis alone in elective colorectal cancer patients.;Infectious complications acknowledge and especially anastomotic leakage (AL) severely impede the recuperation of patients following colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery. When the normal gut barrier fails, as in AL, pathogenic microorganisms can enter the circulation and may cause severe sepsis which is associated with substantial mortality. Moreover, AL has a negative impact on the CRC prognosis. Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) employs oral nonabsorbable antibiotics to eradicate pathogenic microorganisms before elective tumour resection. METHODS: In this multicentre randomised clinical trial, perioperative SDD in addition to standard antibiotic prophylaxis is compared with standard antibiotic prophylaxis alone in patients with CRC who undergo elective surgical resection with a curative intent. The SDD regimen consists of colistin, tobramycin and amphotericin B. The primary objectives of this randomised clinical trial are to evaluate if perioperative SDD reduces the incidence of clinical AL and its septic consequences as well as other infectious complications. A main secondary objective is improvement of the cancer-free survival. A total of 762 patients will be included in total for sufficient power. CONCLUSION: It is hypothesised that SDD will reduce clinical AL thereby reducing the morbidity and the mortality in CRC patients. FUNDING: The trial is investigator-initiated, investigator-driven and supported by the Dutch Digestive Foundation (WO 11-06) and the private Posthumus Meyes Fund. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01740947.
4;Randomized clinical trial of selective decontamination of the digestive tract in elective colorectal cancer surgery (SELECT trial).;"Infectious complications and anastomotic leakage affect approximately 30 per cent of patients after colorectal cancer surgery. The aim of this multicentre randomized trial was to investigate whether selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) reduces these complications of elective colorectal cancer surgery. METHODS: The effectiveness of SDD was evaluated in a multicentre, open-label RCT in six centres in the Netherlands. Patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for elective curative surgery with a primary anastomosis were eligible. Oral colistin, tobramycin and amphotericin B were administered to patients in the SDD group to decontaminate the digestive tract. Both treatment and control group received intravenous cefazolin and metronidazole for perioperative prophylaxis. Mechanical bowel preparation was given for left-sided colectomies, sigmoid and anterior resections. Anastomotic leakage was the primary outcome; infectious complications and mortality were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The outcomes for 228 patients randomized to the SDD group and 227 randomized to the control group were analysed. The trial was stopped after interim analysis demonstrated that superiority was no longer attainable. Effective SDD was confirmed by interspace DNA profiling analysis of rectal swabs. Anastomotic leakage was observed in 14 patients (6·1 per cent) in the SDD group and in 22 patients (9·7 per cent) in the control group (odds ratio (OR) 0·61, 95 per cent c.i. 0·30 to 1·22). Fewer patients in the SDD group had one or more infectious complications than patients in the control group (14·9 versus 26·9 per cent respectively; OR 0·48, 0·30 to 0·76). Multivariable analysis indicated that SDD reduced the rate of infectious complications (OR 0·47, 0·29 to 0·76). CONCLUSION: SDD reduces infectious complications after colorectal cancer resection but did not significantly reduce anastomotic leakage in this trial.

5;Anastomotic dehiscence in colorectal surgery: is bowel preparation still relevant ?;"The belief that mechanical bowel preparation prior to colon and rectal surgery reduces the risk of anastomotic dehiscence is now being disputed. We performed a prospective study over a 3 year period to examine this issue. All patients undergoing an eledtive colon or rectal resection and primary anastomosis were randomised to bowel preparation (BP) or no bowel preparation (NBP) prior to surgery. The BP group were restricted to fluids, light diet and a morning and evening dose of Picolax (Ferring AB, Sweden) on the day before surgery. Normal diet was continued in the NBP group until the night before surgery, otherwise perioperative management and surgical technique were identical in both groups. Age and Dukes staging were similar in the BP (n=87) and NBP (n=116) groups. Indications for surgery were carcinoma (n=141) diverticular disease (n=22), inflammatory bowel disease (n=28) and miscellaneous (n=12). Operations performed were; right hemicolectomies (15 BP/37NBP), left colonic resections (16/24), anterior resections (48/44), and total colectomies (8/11). There were 8 clinical anastomitic leaks, 3 in each anterior resection group, and one in each group after a total colectomy. The 2 deaths were both in the BP group; one was secondary to anastomotic leakage. These data indicate that bowel preparation does not reduce the incidence of anastomotic dehiscence in colorectal surgery."
6;Orally Administered Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole and Metronidazole as Infection Prophylaxis in Elective Colorectal Surgery.;This randomized clinical trial evaluated orally administered trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and metronidazole (TSM) in elective colorectal surgery as prophylactic for post-operative surgical site infections (SSI). METHODS: Patients undergoing elective colorectal resection were evaluated for inclusion. Randomized subjects received either orally administered TSM or intravenously administered cefuroxime and metronidazole (control group, CXM). The primary endpoint was the rate of SSI. RESULTS: A total of 1073 subjects were randomized to either control (540) or TSM (533). 486 patients in the TSM group and 499 in the control group were followed-up with after 4 weeks. Thirty-seven (3.8%) patients were afflicted by SSI at discharge from hospital and 69 (7.0%) at follow-up four weeks after surgery. After four weeks, the rate of incisional SSI was 7.0% in the TSM group and 3.6% in the control group (p=0.022). For organ/space SSI and the other complications monitored in the study, no differences were observed between the groups. CONCLUSION: Orally administered TSM as prophylaxis before elective colorectal surgery results in a low rate of organ/space SSI but an increased rate of incisional SSI compared with intravenously administered cefuroxime and metronidazole. Thus, when considering orally administered TSM, because of environmental concerns or for economic reasons, the slightly increased infection rate has to be kept in mind.
7;Controversies in antimicrobial prophylaxis.;"This paper examines four controversies in antimicrobial prophylaxis. Duration of prophylaxis: Antimicrobial agents must be present in the tissues throughout the operation. Usually, a single preoperative or intraoperative dose will suffice; postoperative doses are unnecessary. Third-generation cephalosporins: no clinical evidence supports their use for surgical prophylaxis. Optimal prophylaxis for colorectal surgery: the information is conflicting, but oral agents combined with a parenteral antibiotic may be optimal. Prophylaxis for patients with indwelling prosthetic joints or vascular grafts: prophylaxis is unnecessary for procedures like dental work that cause transient bacteremia, but established infections should receive prompt, vigorous antimicrobial therapy."
8;Whole bowel irrigation--an alternative to traditional bowel washout.;The objective of this study was to determine whether or not whole bowel irrigation through oral route was a safe and  alternative to traditional bowel washout per rectum in preparation for large bowel surgery. Out of a total of 114 patients, 32 had whole bowel irrigation, 71 had traditional washout and 11 had no bowel preparation. The irrigation involved approximately 12 litres of normal saline over an average period of 3 1/4 hours. The preparation of the colon by whole bowel irrigation was better as indicated by total absence of faeces and the cleanliness of the colon at operation. However, there was no significant difference in wound infection rate between the two groups although the severity of wound infection was lesser in the first group. There were no major complications like anastomotic breakdown, burst abdomen, abscess or fistula formation and septicaemia in this group. Based on this experience we believe that whole bowel irrigation is a good alternative method of bowel preparation. The advantages of this method are that it is short and rapid, avoiding prolonged pre-operative hospitalisation and is  to most patients.
9;Voice and swallowing after laryngopharyngectomy and free ileocolic flap reconstruction for hypopharyngeal cancer.;Sixteen patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma who underwent laryngopharyngectomy had immediate reconstruction with a free ileocolic flap to restore voice and swallowing. All patients had satisfactory voice production and swallowing in the early postoperative stage. Maintaining adequate tension and decreasing redundancy of the transferred colon prevented food pooling and provided smooth, rapid swallowing. A wedge resection of the subserosa of the ileocecal valve to increase the intraluminal pressure helped prevent food reflux and provide good phonation. Although this modified technique yielded good initial results, both voice and swallowing deteriorated after concurrent chemoradiotherapy, possibly because of radiation injury to the transferred acknowledge bowel.
10;Safety and efficacy of sodium hyaluronate gel and chitosan in preventing postoperative peristomal adhesions after defunctioning enterostomy: a prospective randomized controlled trials.;"Peristomal adhesions complicate closure of defunctioning enterostomy. The efficacy and safety of sodium hyaluronate gel and chitosan in preventing postoperative adhesion have not been extensively studied. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sodium hyaluronate gel and chitosan in the prevention of postoperative peristomal adhesions. This was a prospective randomized controlled study. One hundred and fourteen patients undergoing defunctioning enterostomy were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to receive sodium hyaluronate gel (SHG group) or chitosan (CH group) or no antiadhesion treatment (CON group) during defunctioning enterostomy. The safety outcomes included toxicities, stoma‐related complications, and shortterm and long‐term postoperative complications. Eighty‐seven (76.3%) of the 114 patients received closure of enterostomy, during which occurrence and severity of intra‐Abdominal adhesions were visually assessed by a blinded assessor. Incidence of adhesion appears to be lower in patients received sodium hyaluronate gel or chitosan but differences did not reach a significant level (SHG group vs CH group vs CON group: 62.1% vs 62.1% vs 82.8%, P=0.15). Compared with the CON group, severity of postoperative adhesion was significantly decreased in the SHG and CH group (SHG group vs CH group vs CON group: 31.0%vs 27.6%vs 62.1%; P=0.01). There was no significant difference in the occurrence of postoperative complications and other safety outcomes among the 3 groups. Sodium hyaluronate gel or chitosan smeared around the limbs of a defunctioning enterostomy was safe and effective in the prevention of postoperative peristomal adhesions."
